![ALPACA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/231df1cd-66f2-445a-983d-873bdef14ef1)

ALPACA is an adaptive loyalty program and crypto airdrop platform built using **SUI dApp Kit** and **React**. It aims to integrate loyalty tokens, interest yielding, and crypto transactions using **QR payments**. The platform uses blockchain technology to create a seamless, decentralized ecosystem for buyers and sellers, rewarding participants with loyalty tokens and other benefits.

## Features
- **SUI dApp Kit Integration**: This project uses SUI's dApp Kit for wallet integration, connecting users with their wallets directly from the app.
- **React**: The front-end is built with React, offering a user-friendly interface to interact with the blockchain.
- **Loyalty Tokens**: Users can earn loyalty tokens through purchases, contributing to the value of the platform.
- **Interest Yielding**: The system will offer interest on loyalty tokens, providing value to the users.
- **QR Payment**: The payment system is based on QR codes, enabling easy transactions using cryptocurrency.

## How it Works
1. **Buyer**:
   - The buyer initiates a payment using the platform's wallet (integrated via QR).
   - They use **QR Payment** for a seamless payment experience.
   - After completing the payment, the buyer earns **Loyalty Tokens**.
   - Loyalty tokens can be used for future transactions for discount/rewards.
   - Deposited money inside wallet can used for earning **Interest Yielding**.

2. **Seller**:
   - The seller receives the payment in cryptocurrency (e.g., **USDC (Sui)**) directly to their wallet.
   - The seller also gets rewarded with **Interest Yielding** based on their transaction volume.

The process is diagrammatically represented below:

## What Has Been Done
- **Basic UI**: Developed a simple, clean user interface using **React**.
- **Smart Contract for Ideation**: A smart contract has been created to prototype the workflow, including loyalty token generation and reward mechanism.
- **Wallet Integration**: **SUI dApp Kit** has been integrated for seamless wallet connection and transaction handling.

## What's Planned for the Future
- **Wormhole Connect Integration**: The integration of Wormhole Connect to allow cross-chain interoperability.
- **QR Transactions using USDC (SUI)**: Enabling users to make seamless transactions using USDC on the SUI blockchain.
- **Airdropping Loyalty Tokens**: Creating a system for airdropping loyalty tokens to users based on specific actions or milestones.
- **Interest Yielding Platform**: Implementing the feature to offer interest on loyalty tokens, providing users with passive rewards.

## Limitations
- **Limited Time**: Due to limited time constraints, the project is still in its early stage, focusing on core features and prototypes.
- **Learning Curve with SUI**: As the team had limited experience with the **SUI** blockchain, the development process was a learning experience, and the current implementation reflects the best we could accomplish under these conditions.

## Conclusion
While still in its early stages, **ALPACA** represents a promising idea that merges loyalty programs with the power of decentralized finance (DeFi). With continuous development, the platform aims to bring about a more rewarding and engaging experience for users in the blockchain space.
